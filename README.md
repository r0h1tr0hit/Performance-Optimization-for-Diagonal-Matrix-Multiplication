# Performance-Optimization-for-Diagonal-Matrix-Multiplication
To implement and performance optimize "diagonal matrix multiplication (DMM)". Optimize the single-threaded programs by analyzing relevant hardware performance counter values, and then parallelize the program to utilize multiple threads (using pthreads). 
Then we need to write CUDA version of the DMM program that we had optimized and multi-threaded for CPU.
